            Iâ€™m a Full Stack Software Developer with strong expertise in Java,
            Spring Boot, and the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js,
            Node.js). I specialize in building scalable backend systems and
            efficient front-end interfaces, driven by a passion for clean code
            and seamless user experiences. With hands-on experience in NestJS,
            PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS (EC2, S3), and Agile methodologies, Iâ€™ve
            developed and deployed robust web applications that enhance
            performance, reduce latency, and scale effectively. Whether itâ€™s
            crafting high-performance APIs or optimizing system architecture, I
            bring a problem-solving mindset, strong communication skills, and a
            commitment to delivering quality in every project I work on.
